Complete Self-Taught Computer Science Journal

Welcome to my journal, this is where I write about my self-taught computer science experience because I want to learn
computer science completely without missing details.

But complete doesn't mean everything about computer science, there are a a lot of fields that I just don't have time to learn. By complete, I mean that every fundamental topics covered in CS.

To start, I need to learn a programming language called C using a book called "The C Programming Language Second Edition [ANSI C]".

This is to complement the Computer Science I'll learn in a university/college instead of replacing them.
